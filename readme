simple single thread webserver for displaying streaming 
output via firefox and chrome browser similar to a security 
web camera for the flir lepton module.

Does not work with Internet Explorer.


Once installed.

sudo python web.py 


starts a listener on port 8080 of your pi.



Access vi firefox

http://YourRaspberryIpAddress:8080 from your host machine.



For chrome you will need to open the ChromeOnly.html and edit your 
raspiberry ip address into it.  And then open the chromeonly.html from your desktop 
as chrome needs additional help in working but can be made to work.


THe exe's are compiled with 

Raspberry pi b+ (512 meg edition).


Wiring of the lepton is /dev/spidev0.1 which is ce1 (pin 26) ?

Uses python and pil so you will have to have those installed.

For other Models of pi assumed you can just remake the source code from the directories.

Most of the code is original pure with some glue logic.  The only real difference is agc 
enable/disable in the Lepton_I2C.cpp module.


Im sure it can be made better but its food for thought.


Cheers
